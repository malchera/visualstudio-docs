# Using the Code Metrics Results window

The **Code Metrics Results** window displays the data that is generated by the code metrics analysis. For more information about code metrics data values, see [Code metrics values](../code-quality/code-metrics-values.md).

## Displaying code metrics results

The **Code Metrics Results** window is displayed automatically when you generate code metrics results. You can also display the window at any time.

### To display the Code Metrics Results window

- On the **Analyze** menu, choose **Windows** > **Code Metrics Results**.

   \- or -

- On the **View** menu, choose **Other Windows** > **Code Metrics Results**.

The **Code Metrics Results** window is displayed, even if it contains no results.

### To view code metrics details

If code metrics results have been generated, expand the tree in the **Hierarchy** column.

## Filtering code metrics results

You can filter the results that are displayed in the **Code Metrics Results** window by using the toolbar at the top. For example, you might want to see only the results that have a maintainability index below 65.

The **Filter** drop-down box contains the names of the results columns. When a filter is defined, it is added to the bottom of the list together with an indentation. The list can contain the last ten filters that were defined.

### To filter the code metrics results

1.  From the **Filter** list, select the column name.

2.  In **Min**, type the minimum value to be displayed.

3.  In **Max**, type the maximum value to be displayed.

4.  Click the **Apply Filter** button.

5.  To see the result details, expand the hierarchy tree.

## Adding, removing, and rearranging data columns

## Copying data to the clipboard or Excel

You can select and copy a selected row of code metrics data to the clipboard as a text string that contains one line for the name and value of each data column. You can also click **Open Selection in Microsoft Excel** to export all of the code metrics results to an Excel spreadsheet.

## Creating a work item based on code metric results

You can create a [Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS)](/vsts/index) work item that is based on results in the **Code Metric Results** window. When the work item is created, Visual Studio automatically enters a title in the **Title** field and code metrics data under the **History** tab.

For more information about VSTS work items, see [Work items (VSTS)](/vsts/work/work-items/index).
