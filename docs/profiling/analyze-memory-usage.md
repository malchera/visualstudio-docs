# Analyze memory usage
Use the debugger-integrated **Memory Usage** diagnostic tool to find memory leaks and inefficient memory usage. The Memory Usage tool lets you take one or more *snapshots* of the managed and native memory heap. You can collect snapshots of .NET, native, or mixed mode (.NET and native) apps.  
  
-   You can analyze a single snapshot to understand the relative impact of the object types on memory use, and to find code in your app that uses memory inefficiently.  
  
-   You can also compare (diff) two snapshots of an app to find areas in your code that cause the memory use to increase over time.  

For detailed instructions, see the [Analyze memory usage](../profiling/memory-usage.md) tutorial. To analyze memory usage without attaching the debugger, see [Memory usage without the debugger](memory-usage-without-debugging2.md).
