# How to: Programmatically List Recently Used Workbook Files
  The <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel._Application.RecentFiles%2A> property returns a collection that contains the names of all the files that appear in the Microsoft Office Excel list of recently used files. The length of the list varies depending on the number of files the user has selected to retain. You can display the results in a range.
