# SetWefProcessId Method
  Provides the process identifier that will run Web Extensions Framework (WEF) content.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
HRESULT SetWefProcessId(  
    [in] DWORD dwProcessId  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
  
|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|*dwProcessId*|The process identifier that will be used to run WEF content.|  
  
## Return Value  
 An HRESULT value that indicates whether the method completed successfully.  
  
## Remarks  
 This method must be called after the WEF content process is created but before any WEF content runs.  
  
 If you want the development environment to attach a debugger to the WEF content process, the environment must perform this operation in your implementation of this method.
