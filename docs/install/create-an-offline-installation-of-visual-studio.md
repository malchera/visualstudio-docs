# Create an offline installation of Visual Studio 2017

We designed the Visual Studio 2017 installer to work well in a wide variety of network and machine conditions.

- The new workload-based model means you'll need to download far less than with previous versions of Visual Studio: as little as 300 MB for the smallest installation;
- Compared to a generic "ISO" or zip file, we download only the packages you need for your machine. For example, we don't download 64-bit files if you don't need them;
- During the installation process, we try three different download technologies (WebClient, BITS and WinInet) to minimize interference with anti-virus and proxy software;
- The files you'll need to install Visual Studio are distributed on a global delivery network, so we can get them to you from a local server.

We recommend that you try the [Visual Studio web installer](https://aka.ms/vsdownload?utm_source=mscom&utm_campaign=msdocsOL)&mdash;we think you'll find it a good experience.

If you want to install offline because your internet connection is unavailable or unreliable, see [Install Visual Studio 2017 on low bandwidth or unreliable network environments](../install/install-vs-inconsistent-quality-network.md). You can use the command line to create a local cache of the files you need to complete an offline install. This process replaces the ISO files available for previous versions.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are an enterprise administrator who wants to perform a deployment of Visual Studio 2017 to a network of client workstations that are firewalled from the internet, see our [Create a network installation of Visual Studio 2017](../install/create-a-network-installation-of-visual-studio.md) and [Install certificates required for Visual Studio offline installation](../install/install-certificates-for-visual-studio-offline.md) pages.
