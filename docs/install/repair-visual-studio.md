# Repair Visual Studio 2017

Sometimes your Visual Studio installation becomes damaged or corrupted. A repair can fix this.

1. Find the Visual Studio Installer on your computer.

     For example, on a computer running Windows 10 Anniversary Update, select **Start**, and then scroll to the letter **V**, where it's listed as **Visual Studio Installer**.

     >[!NOTE]
     On some computers, the Visual Studio Installer might be listed under the letter **"M"** as the **Microsoft Visual Studio Installer**.<br/><br/> Alternatively, you can find the Visual Studio Installer in the following location: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\Installer\vs_installer.exe`

2. Click or tap to start the installer, then select **More**, and then select **Repair**.
