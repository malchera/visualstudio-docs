# Quickstart: Personalize the Visual Studio IDE and Editor

In this 5-10 minute quickstart, we'll customize the Visual Studio color theme and two text colors in the **Text Editor**.

If you haven't already installed Visual Studio, go to the [Visual Studio downloads](https://aka.ms/vsdownload?utm_source=mscom&utm_campaign=msdocs) page to install it for free.

## Set the color theme

The default color theme for Visual Studio 2017 is called **Blue**. Let's change it to **Dark**.

1. On the menu bar, choose **Tools** > **Options**.

1. On the **Environment** > **General** options page, change the **Color theme** selection to **Dark**, and then choose **OK**.

   The color theme for the entire IDE is changed to **Dark**.

> [!TIP]
> You can install additional predefined themes by installing the **Visual Studio Color Theme Editor** from the [Visual Studio marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioPlatformTeam.VisualStudio2017ColorThemeEditor). After you install this tool, additional color themes appear in the **Color theme** drop-down list.

## Change text color

Now we'll customize some text colors for the Editor. First, let's open an XML file to see the default colors.

1. From the menu bar, choose **File** > **New** > **File**.

1. In the **New File** dialog box, under the **General** category, choose **XML File**, and then choose **Open**.

1. Paste the following XML below the line that contains `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>`.

   ```xml

   ```

   Notice that the line numbers are a turquoise-blue color, and the XML attributes are a light blue color. We are going to change the text color for these items.

1. To open the **Options** dialog box, choose **Tools** > **Options** from the menu bar.

1. Under **Environment**, choose the **Fonts and Colors** category.

   Notice that the text under **Show settings for** says **Text Editor**&mdash;this is what we want. You might expand the drop-down list just to see the extensive list of places where you can customize fonts and text color.

1. To change the color of the line numbers text, in the **Display items** list, choose **Line Number**. In the **Item foreground** box, choose **Olive**.

   Some languages have their own specific fonts and colors settings. If you are a C++ developer and you want to change the color used for functions, for example, you can look for **C++ Functions** in the **Display items** list.

1. Before we exit out of the dialog box, let's also change the color of XML attributes. In the **Display items** list, scroll down to **XML Attribute** and select it. In the **Item foreground** box, choose **Lime**. Choose **OK** to save our selections and close the dialog box.

   The line numbers are now an olive color, and the XML attributes are a bright, lime green. If you open another file type, such as a C++ or C# code file, you'll see that the line numbers also appear in the olive color.

We explored just a couple ways of customizing the colors in Visual Studio. We hope that you'll explore the other customization options in the **Options** dialog box, to truly make Visual Studio your own.
