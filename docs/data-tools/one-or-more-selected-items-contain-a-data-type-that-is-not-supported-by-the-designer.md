# One or more selected items contain a data type that is not supported by the designer

One or more of the items dragged from **Server Explorer**/**Database Explorer** onto the [!INCLUDE[vs_ordesigner_short](../data-tools/includes/vs_ordesigner_short_md.md)] contains a data type that is not supported by the [!INCLUDE[vs_ordesigner_short](../data-tools/includes/vs_ordesigner_short_md.md)] for example, [CLR User-Defined Types](/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/sql/clr-user-defined-types).

## To correct this error

1. Create a view that is based on the desired table and that does not include the unsupported data type.

2. Drag the view from **Server Explorer**/**Database Explorer** onto the designer.
