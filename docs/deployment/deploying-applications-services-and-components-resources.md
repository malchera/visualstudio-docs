# Overview of deployment in Visual Studio

By deploying an application, service, or component, you distribute it for installation on other computers, devices, servers, or in the cloud. You choose the appropriate method in Visual Studio for the type of deployment that you need. 

For many common app types, you can deploy your application right from Solution Explorer in Visual Studio.
