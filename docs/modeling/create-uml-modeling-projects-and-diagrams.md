# Create UML modeling projects and diagrams

Starting with Visual Studio 2017, the UML Designers have been removed from Visual Studio. For more information, see this [blog post](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudioalm/2016/10/14/uml-designers-have-been-removed-layer-designer-now-supports-live-architectural-analysis/).

If you still need to use UML, you can use Visual Studio 2015 Enterprise edition, which is side-by-side compatible with later versions of Visual Studio.

For information about using UML in Visual Studio 2015, see:
