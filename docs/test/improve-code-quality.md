# Testing tools in Visual Studio

Visual Studio testing tools can help you and your team develop and sustain high standards of code excellence.

- The **Test Explorer** window makes it easy to integrate [unit tests](../test/unit-test-your-code.md) into your development practice. You can use the Microsoft unit test framework or one of several third-party and open source frameworks.

- [IntelliTest](../test/generate-unit-tests-for-your-code-with-intellitest.md) automatically generates unit tests and test data for your managed code.

- [Code coverage](../test/using-code-coverage-to-determine-how-much-code-is-being-tested.md) determines what proportion of your project's code is actually being tested by coded tests such as unit tests.

- [Microsoft Fakes](../test/isolating-code-under-test-with-microsoft-fakes.md) help you isolate the code you are testing by replacing other parts of the application with stubs or shims.

- [Live Unit Testing](../test/live-unit-testing.md) automatically runs unit tests in the background, and graphically displays code coverage and test results in the Visual Studio code editor.

- [Coded UI tests](../test/use-ui-automation-to-test-your-code.md) enable you to test your application through its user interface.

- [Load testing](../test/quickstart-create-a-load-test-project.md) simulates load on a server application by running unit tests and Web performance tests.

> [!NOTE]
> Unit testing is availble in all editions of Visual Studio. Other testing tools, such as live unit testing, IntelliTest, and Coded UI tests are only available in Visual Studio Enterprise edition. For more information about editions see [Compare Visual Studio 2017 IDEs](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/compare/).
