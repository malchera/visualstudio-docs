# How to: Add Comments while Analyzing a Completed Load Test

After a load test completes, or after you load a test result, you can use the Load Test Analyzer to add a description and an analysis comment to the load test. The description and the analysis comment will be stored permanently with the load test result. For more information, see [How to: Access Load Test Results for Analysis](../test/how-to-access-load-test-results-for-analysis.md).

The description that you enter also displays in the **Description** column that is associated with the load test in the **Open and Manage Test Results** dialog box in the **Load Test Editor**. For more information, see [How to: Access Load Test Results for Analysis](../test/how-to-access-load-test-results-for-analysis.md). Additionally, the comments are displayed when you create an Excel report for the load test results. For more information, see [Reporting Load Tests Results for Test Comparisons or Trend Analysis](../test/compare-load-test-results.md).
