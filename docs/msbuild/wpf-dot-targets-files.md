# WPF .Targets Files
[!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winclient](../misc/includes/tlasharptla_winclient_md.md)] extends the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_msbuild](../msbuild/includes/tlasharptla_msbuild_md.md)] by adding a set of [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../msbuild/includes/tla2sharptla_wpf_md.md)]-specific tasks that are combined into a special .targets file, **Microsoft.WinFX.targets**. This file combines the set of [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_msbuild](../msbuild/includes/tla2sharptla_msbuild_md.md)] tasks that are required to build an [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_msbuild](../msbuild/includes/tla2sharptla_msbuild_md.md)] project in [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winclient](../misc/includes/tlasharptla_winclient_md.md)].
