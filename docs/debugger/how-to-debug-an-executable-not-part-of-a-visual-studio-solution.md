# How to: Debug an executable that is not part of a Visual Studio solution
Sometimes, you may want to debug an executable (.exe file) that is not part of a [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] project. It may be an executable you created outside of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] or an executable you received from someone else.  
  
The usual answer to this problem is to start the executable outside of Visual Studio and attach to it using the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] debugger. For more information, see [Attach to Running Processes](../debugger/attach-to-running-processes-with-the-visual-studio-debugger.md).  
  
Attaching to an application requires some manual steps, so it takes a few seconds. This slight delay means that attaching will not help if you are trying to debug a problem that occurs during startup. Also, if you are debugging a program that does not wait for user input and finishes quickly, you may not have time to attach to it. If you have [!INCLUDE[vcprvc](../code-quality/includes/vcprvc_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[vcprvc](../code-quality/includes/vcprvc_md.md)] installed, you can create an EXE project for such a program.

> [!NOTE]
>  Not all programming languages support EXE projects.

When you are debugging an executable that is not part of your Visual Studio solution, the available debugging features may be limited, whether you attach to a running executable or add the executable to a [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] solution.

- If you have the source code, the best approach is to import the source code into [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] and create a debug build of the executable in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)].
- If you don't have the source code, and if the executable was built without [debug information](../debugger/how-to-set-debug-and-release-configurations.md) in a compatible format, available debugging features are very limited. 
  
### To create an EXE project for an existing executable  
  
1.  On the **File** menu, click **Open** and select **Project**.  
  
2.  In the **Open Project** dialog box, click the drop-down list next to the **File name** box, and select **All Project Files**.  
  
3.  Locate the executable, and click **OK**.  

    This creates a temporary solution that contains the executable.

5.  Start the executable by choosing an execution command, such as **Start**, from the **Debug** menu.    
  
### To import an executable into a Visual Studio solution  
  
1.  On the **File** menu, point to **Add Project**, and then click **Existing Project**.  
  
2.  In the **Add Existing Project** dialog box, click the drop-down list next to the **File name** box, and select **All Project Files**.  
  
3.  Locate and select the executable.  
  
4.  Click **OK**.  
  
5.  Start the executable by choosing an execution command, such as **Start**, from the **Debug** menu.
