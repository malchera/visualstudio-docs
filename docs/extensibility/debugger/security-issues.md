# Security Issues
To debug a program using Visual Studio, the only permissions needed are the same ones a developer needs to run the program. This includes remote debugging for most situations (some situations involving other services, such as the Internet Information Service, may require a higher level of permissions).  
  
 While Visual Studio is running, the process debug manager (PDM) tracks debug processes on the local machine. Remotely, a program called msvsmon.exe is started by the developer to handle remote debugging and make the PDM available. (Note that msvsmon.exe is not a service and must be started manually to enable remote debugging on that machine.) When Visual Studio (or msvsmon.exe) is not running, no processes are tracked for debugging.  
  
 This means that a developer can debug programs he or she started with no special permissions. The developer can even debug processes started by someone else if that other person is a member of the same security group. And to enable remote debugging, it is necessary only to copy the necessary files to the remote machine and start msvsmon.exe (see [Remote Debugging](../../debugger/remote-debugging.md) for more details).
