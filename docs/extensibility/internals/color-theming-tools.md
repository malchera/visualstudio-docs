# Color Theming Tools
The VS SDK provides several tools to help you create and manage color themes.  
  
-   The [VSIX Color Editor](../../extensibility/internals/vsix-color-editor.md) tool can create and edit custom colors for Visual Studio.  
  
-   The [VSIX Color Compiler](../../extensibility/internals/vsix-color-compiler.md) tool converts existing Visual Studio theme .xml files into .pkgdef for your extension.
