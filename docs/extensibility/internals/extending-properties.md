# Extending Properties
The [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] **Properties** window is a universal property browser for COM and COM+ components and supports all [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] products. The **Properties** window works with `ITypeInfo` type information and COM+ metadata to list the design-time properties for the currently selected object in any other window in the integrated development environment (IDE).  
  
 The **Properties** window, which can be opened by pressing F4 on the keyboard, or selecting **Properties Window** on the **View** menu, is used to view and edit configuration-independent, design-time properties and events of selected objects. Configuration-dependent properties, associated with solutions and projects, are displayed on [Property Pages](../../extensibility/internals/property-pages.md). For more information, [Managing Configuration Options](../../extensibility/internals/managing-configuration-options.md).

Properties window  
  
 This section provides detailed information that relates to the individual areas of the **Properties** window and the interfaces that you must implement and call to populate the window.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Properties Window Overview](../../extensibility/internals/properties-window-overview.md)  
 Explains the purpose of the **Properties** window relative to the tool window and the document window.  
  
 [Template Policy and the Properties Window](../../extensibility/internals/template-policy-and-the-properties-window.md)  
 Discusses how a project is contained in an enterprise template project, and how that enterprise template project can enforce policy.  
  
 [Properties Window Fields and Interfaces](../../extensibility/internals/properties-window-fields-and-interfaces.md)  
 Explains the basis for selection that determines what information is displayed in the **Properties** window.  
  
 [Properties Window Object List](../../extensibility/internals/properties-window-object-list.md)  
 Describes the purpose of the **Properties** window object list, describing how, when a different object from this list triggers a call, the environment is informed that a new object has been selected.  
  
 [Properties Window Buttons](../../extensibility/internals/properties-window-buttons.md)  
 Explains the purpose of the four default buttons displayed on the **Properties** window toolbar.  
  
 [Properties Display Grid](../../extensibility/internals/properties-display-grid.md)  
 Explains where the property names and property values fields are found in the grid.  
  
## Related Sections  
 [Project Types](../../extensibility/internals/project-types.md)  
 Discusses projects as the building blocks of the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] IDE.  
  
 [Compiling and Building](../../ide/compiling-and-building-in-visual-studio.md)  
 Describes how you can use the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] Platform for continuously testing and debugging applications as you build them.  
  
 [IDispatch](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms221608.aspx)  
 Describes the `IDispatch` interface, which was first designed to support automation, providing a late-bound mechanism to access and retrieve information about the methods and properties of an object.  
  
 [Managing application settings (.NET)](../../ide/managing-application-settings-dotnet.md)  
 Provides an overview of application settings that let you configure your application so that property values are stored in an external configuration file instead of the application's compiled code.  
  
 [Solutions and Projects](../../ide/solutions-and-projects-in-visual-studio.md)  
 Explains how [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] efficiently manages the items such as references, data connections, folders, and files that are required by your development effort through solutions and projects.  
  
 [Extending Other Parts of Visual Studio](../../extensibility/extending-other-parts-of-visual-studio.md)  
 Explains how to use [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] services to create UI elements that match the rest of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)].
