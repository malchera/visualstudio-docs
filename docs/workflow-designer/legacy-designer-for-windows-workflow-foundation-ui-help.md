# Legacy Designer for Windows Workflow Foundation UI Help

This section contains the context-sensitive Help topics for the legacy Windows Workflow Designer in Visual Studio 2010. Use the legacy designer when you need to target the .NET Framework version 3.5 or the WinFX.

You can access these topics from the Visual Studio user interface by pressing **F1** when a legacy Workflow Designer dialog box is open.
