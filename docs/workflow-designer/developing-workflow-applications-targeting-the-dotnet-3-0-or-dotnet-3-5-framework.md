# Developing Workflow Applications Targeting the .NET 3.0 or .NET 3.5 Framework

Visual Studio 2010 provides the Windows Workflow Designer for creating Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) applications that target the .NET Framework 4. The designer uses the familiar Visual Studio user interface for the graphical construction and debugging of workflow applications.

Visual Studio 2010 also provides access to a legacy workflow designer that can be used to target the .NET Framework version 3.5 or the WinFX. This section contains guidance on using this legacy designer.
