# Using Themes in Workflows (Legacy)

This topic describes how to use themes in Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) when using the legacy Windows Workflow Designer that targets the .NET Framework version 3.5 or the WinFX.

You can customize the look of your workflows with the legacy designer by using Windows Workflow Foundation themes. A theme defines the background and foreground colors, styles, icons, and other visual elements of a workflow. You can save themes for reuse by other workflows.

You create and edit themes by using the [Theme Configuration Dialog Box (Legacy)](../workflow-designer/theme-configuration-dialog-box-legacy.md). To open this dialog box, select **Create New Theme** on the **Workflow** menu, or right-click the workflow design surface and select **Create New Theme**.

You can select default and saved custom themes by using the [Themes, Workflow Designer, Options Dialog Box (Legacy)](../workflow-designer/themes-workflow-designer-options-dialog-box-legacy.md). To open this dialog box, click **Select Custom Theme** on the **Workflow** menu (or right-click the workflow design surface and click **Select Custom Theme**) and then select the **Workflow Designer** option. Select the theme you want and click **OK**.
