# How to: Create a SharePoint Solution Package by Using MSBuild Tasks
  You can build, clean, and validate a SharePoint package (.wsp) using command-line MSBuild tasks on a development computer. You can also use these commands to automate the build process by using Team Foundation Server on a build computer.  
  
## Building a SharePoint Package  
  
#### To build a SharePoint package  
  
1.  On the Windows **Start** menu, choose **All Programs**, **Accessories**, **Command Prompt**.  
  
2.  Change to the directory where your SharePoint project is located.  
  
3.  Enter the following command to create a package for the project. Replace *ProjectFileName* with the name of the project.  
  
    ```cmd  
    msbuild /t:Package ProjectFileName  
    ```  
  
     For example, you could run one of the following commands to package a SharePoint project called ListDefinition1.  
  
    ```cmd  
    msbuild /t:Package ListDefinition1.vbproj  
    msbuild /t:Package ListDefinition1.csproj  
    ```  
  
## Cleaning a SharePoint Package  
  
#### To clean a SharePoint package  
  
1.  Open a command prompt window.  
  
2.  Change to the directory where your SharePoint project is located.  
  
3.  Enter the following command to clean a package for the project. Replace *ProjectFileName* with the name of the project.  
  
    ```cmd  
    msbuild /t:CleanPackage ProjectFileName  
    ```  
  
     For example, you could run one of the following commands to clean a SharePoint project called ListDefinition1.  
  
    ```cmd  
    msbuild /t:CleanPackage ListDefinition1.vbproj  
    msbuild /t:CleanPackage ListDefinition1.csproj  
    ```  
  
## Validating a SharePoint Package  
  
#### To validate a SharePoint package  
  
1.  Open a command prompt window.  
  
2.  Change to the directory where your SharePoint project is located.  
  
3.  Enter the following command to validate a package for the project. Replace *ProjectFileName* with the name of the project.  
  
    ```cmd  
    msbuild /t:ValidatePackage ProjectFileName  
    ```  
  
     For example, you could run one of the following commands to validate a SharePoint project called ListDefinition1.  
  
    ```cmd  
    msbuild /t:ValidatePackage ListDefinition1.vbproj  
    msbuild /t:ValidatePackage ListDefinition1.csproj  
    ```  
  
## Setting Properties in a SharePoint Package  
  
#### To set a property in a SharePoint package  
  
1.  Open a command prompt window.  
  
2.  Change to the directory where your SharePoint project is located.  
  
3.  Enter the following command to set a property in a package for the project. Replace *PropertyName* with the property that you want to set.  
  
    ```cmd  
    msbuild /property:PropertyName=Value  
    ```  
  
     For example, you could run the following command to set the warning level.  
  
    ```cmd  
    msbuild /property:WarningLevel = 2  
    ```
