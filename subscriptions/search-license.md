# Searching and filtering subscribers in Visual Studio subscriptions
The Visual Studio Subscriptions Administration Portal allows you to find a specific subset of subscribers based on various criteria. You can filter the subscriber list by name, email address, subscription level, and various other information. 

1.  To search for a specific group of subscribers, at the top of the table, click **Filter**.
