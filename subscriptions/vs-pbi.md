# Power BI Pro in Visual Studio subscriptions

Transform your data into rich visuals for you to collect and organize. 

## Activation steps
To use Power BI Pro, you’ll need to set up an account or sign in using an existing account. 
1.  Sign in to [https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits?wt.mc_id=o~msft~docs).

2.  Locate the Power BI Pro tile in the Tools section on the Benefits page. Click on the **Get Code** link at the bottom of the benefit tile.   You’ll receive a notification that the code was successfully retrieved.  Click **Activate**.

2. You may already have an account if you’ve activated certain other subscription benefits, such as Office 365 Developer Subscription or Enterprise Mobility + Security.  If an existing account is found, you’ll have the choice to add your Power BI Pro subscription to your existing account or sign up for a new account.  We highly recommend adding it to your existing account so you can access your various benefits with a single user ID.

4.	Next, create your user ID and password.  If you already have an account and you’re creating a new one, you’ll need to provide a different company name than you used on the existing account.  Click **Create my account**.

5.	To make sure a real person is creating an account, we’ll ask you to enter a confirmation code.  Please provide a phone number and choose whether to receive your code via a phone call or text message.  Click **Text me** or **Call me**.

8.	The next page will confirm your Power BI Pro Developer (MSDN) subscription has a $0.00 price.  Click **Next**.

9.	Finally, we’ll collect some payment information.  Don’t worry – you won’t be charged anything.  Notice that the price is still $0.00.  You can choose a credit card, bank account, or invoice as a form of payment.  If you choose **Invoice**, you may be asked for some feedback on why you prefer that payment method.  Please provide the information requested for your preferred payment method, and click **Place order**.

10.	The next page confirms you’re all set to start using Power BI Pro.  The page will provide a link to the sign-in page.  We recommend recording the link to the sign-in page as well as your user ID.  (You will also receive a welcome email at the address you provided when you set up the account.)  You may also see an automated Office 365 Assistant window, which you can use if you have questions.  Click **Let’s get started** to continue.

11.	Now that your Power BI Pro account is set up, you’ll see the Office 365 Admin center, where you can manage users and domains, install Office software, and learn about Office 365.  That’s it!  You’re ready to go.
