# Pluralsight training benefits in Visual Studio subscriptions

Advance your skills with expert-authored courses, learning paths, adaptive skill measurement, and more!  Depending on which Visual Studio subscription or program membership you have, you may be eligible for up to six months of free, unlimited access to the entire Pluralsight catalog. 

The table below details what Pluralsight subscription benefits are available to each Visual Studio subscription type.  Some subscribers will also be able to take advantage of limited courses after their full catalog access subscription expires. Pluralsight will guide you through that process when your full catalog subscription expires. 

 Depending on the type of subscription they have, not all subscribers who have previously used a Pluralsight subscription provided through a Visual Studio subscription will be able to redeem new Pluralsight benefit offers. If you are not eligible to redeem additional Pluralsight training benefits, you'll receive a notification when you attempt to activate the benefit on the Pluralsight website.  


## Activation steps
1. To activate your subscription, connect to [https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits?wt.mc_id=o~msft~docs) and click on the **Get Code** link on the Pluralsight benefit tile, located in the Professional Development section.

    >

2. You’ll receive a notification that the coupon code has been successfully retrieved.  Click **Activate**.

## Frequently asked questions

### Q: I have a Visual Studio Enterprise subscription, but I don't see the Pluralsight tile on the Benefits page. What's wrong? 
A: Not all Visual Studio Enterprise subscriptions include the Pluralsight benefit.  Check the [eligility table](#eligibility) table to see whether your subscription is eligible.

### Q: Do I have access to any customized learning  playlists or channels? 
A: Yes, as a Visual Studio subscriber you get access to expert channels as part of your Pluralsight training benefit. These channels have been specially curated by Microsoft experts and are geared towards learning in the areas of .Net, Azure, DevOps and Mobility. Activate your Pluralsight benefit through your Visual Studio subscription portal [https://my.visualstudio.com](https://my.visualstudio.com?wt.mc_id=o~msft~docs) to get access to these channels on your Pluralsight landing page –

### Q: What happens when my Pluralsight subscription runs out?  
A:  At the end of your free Pluralsight subscription, you have two options:
- You get free 12-month access (Check the [eligility table](#eligibility) table to see whether your subscription is eligible) to a limited set of 50 courses in one of three key areas including: app development on the cloud; AI, machine learning and data; and DevOps in the cloud. Watch for an email from Pluralsight to claim your free access after expiration. You can see a [list of courses](https://help.pluralsight.com/help/which-courses-are-included-with-the-visual-studio-benefit) available under each partial library.
- You may choose to purchase a subscription directly from Pluralsight at a 10% discount which gives you access to their full course catalog.  Please contact [Pluralsight](http://www.pluralsight.com) for full details. 

### Q: My company renews their Visual Studio subscription through an Enterprise Agreement. Does the Pluralsight benefit reset?
A:  No.  The Pluralsight benefit is single use only, tied to the individual.  Once the subscriber consumes the benefit, it does not reset.  This is true for all purchasing channels, including retail, cloud and Volume License (VL) purchases.
